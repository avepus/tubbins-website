    <p>Tubbins doesn't usually smell, but sometimes he has a stinky B. About once a month, there will be a night in which he smells like he repeatedly ate his own shit for two weeks straight until he could keep it down anymore, then vomitted up the two week concentrated shit and proceeded to bathe in it. That's when his momma gives him a much needed bath.</p>
